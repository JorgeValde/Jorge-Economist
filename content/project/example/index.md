Most of the anti-dumping (AD) literature has studied the effects of AD measures on the importing country at the firm and industry level. This project, on the other hand, studies the effects on Brazilian firms and workers of AD duties imposed on Brazilian firms. Economic theory suggests that workers in industries facing increased protectionism would be adversely affected. I test this theory using administrative data from Brazil for the period 1986-2001. I find that AD duties decrease the export revenue from the country imposing the AD; AD duties decrease the employment level only after the duty is finalized and have no significant effect on worker's wages.
