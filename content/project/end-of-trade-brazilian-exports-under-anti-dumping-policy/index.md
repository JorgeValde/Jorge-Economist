Abstract:

<!--StartFragment-->

This paper studies the effects of Antidumping (AD) duties on Brazilian firms during the period of 1989 to 2001. By conducting a survival analysis methodology of the products that are exported to countries that initiate AD duties, I find that these duties increase the risk of such products to exit their destination market. I also find that AD duties are set on larger firms and on products that are less likely to leave the market if no duties were imposed. The level of observation of this study relies on accurately observing country of destination-firm-product specific matching between the export data and the AD investigation. 

This branch of AD literature is not thoroughly explored by previous studies, which instead analyze the effects of AD duties on the country imposing the tariff, not the one receiving and not at this level of detail.
