I am a PhD in Economics (candidate). I hold a MA in Economics (2019), a MA in International Relations (2019) both from Syracuse University and a BS in Economics from University of Chile. My research interests include topics in international trade, political economy and development of Latin American countries. My current research focuses on the effects of Antidumping duties on Brazilian firms and their workers.
